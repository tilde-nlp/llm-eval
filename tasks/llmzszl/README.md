This article introduces the first comprehensive
benchmark for the Polish language at this scale:
LLMzSzŁ (LLMs Behind the School Desk).
It is based on a coherent collection of Polish
national exams, including both academic and
professional tests extracted from the archives
of the Polish Central Examination Board. It
covers 4 types of exams, coming from 154 domains. Altogether, it consists of almost 19k
closed-ended questions. We investigate the performance of open-source multilingual, English,
and Polish LLMs to verify LLMs’ abilities to
transfer knowledge between languages. Also,
the correlation between LLMs and humans at
model accuracy and exam pass rate levels is
examined. We show that multilingual LLMs
can obtain superior results over monolingual
ones; however, monolingual models may be
beneficial when model size matters. Our analysis highlight the potential of LLMs in assisting
with exam validation, particularly in identifying anomalies or errors in examination tasks.
